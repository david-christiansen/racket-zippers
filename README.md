Zippers for Racket
=======

This Racket package defines a zipper abstraction, in the sense
described by Huet. In addition to a general notion of zipper,
automation is provided for zippers of datatypes that are construed as
coproducts of structs by deriving the infrastructure for a struct to
participate in a zipper.

See the package documentation for details.
